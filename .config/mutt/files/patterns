Pattern

 ~A

 =B STRING
messages which contain STRING in the whole message. If IMAP is enabled, searches for STRING on the server, rather than downloading each message and searching it locally.

 =b STRING
messages which contain STRING in the message body. If IMAP is enabled, searches for STRING on the server, rather than downloading each message and searching it locally.

 ~B EXPR 	    messages which contain EXPR in the whole message
 ~b EXPR 	    messages which contain EXPR in the message body
 %C GROUP 	    messages either “To:” or “Cc:” to any member of GROUP
 %c GROUP 	    messages carbon-copied to any member of GROUP
 ~C EXPR 	    messages either “To:” or “Cc:” EXPR
 ~c EXPR 	    messages carbon-copied to EXPR
 ~D          	deleted messages
 ~d MIN - MAX 	messages with “date-sent” in a date range
 %e GROUP   	messages which contain a member of GROUP in the “Sender:” field
 ~E         	expired messages
 ~e EXPR    	messages which contain EXPR in the “Sender:” field
 %f GROUP   	messages originating from any member of GROUP
 ~F          	flagged messages
 ~f EXPR    	messages originating from EXPR
 ~G          	cryptographically encrypted messages
 ~g 	        cryptographically signed messages

 =h STRING
messages which contain STRING in the message header. If IMAP is enabled, searches for STRING on the server, rather than downloading each message and searching it locally; STRING must be of the form “Header: substring” (see below).

 ~H EXPR    	messages with spam attribute matching EXPR
 ~h EXPR    	messages which contain EXPR in the message header
 ~i EXPR 	    messages which match EXPR in the “Message-ID:” field
 ~k         	messages containing PGP key material
 %L GROUP   	messages either originated or received by any member of GROUP
 ~L EXPR    	messages either originated or received by EXPR
 ~l         	messages addressed to a known mailing list
 ~m < MAX   	messages with numbers less than MAX * )
 ~m > MIN   	messages with numbers greater than MIN * )
 ~m MIN , MAX 	messages with offsets (from selected message) in the range MIN to MAX * )
 ~m MIN - MAX 	message in the range MIN to MAX * )
 ~m N       	just message number N * )
 ~N         	new messages
 ~n MIN - MAX  	messages with a score in the range MIN to MAX ** )
 ~O 	        old messages
 ~P 	        messages from you (consults $from, alternates , and local account/hostname information)
 ~p 	        messages addressed to you (consults $from, alternates , and local account/hostname information)
 ~Q 	        messages which have been replied to
 ~R 	        read messages
 ~r MIN - MAX 	messages with “date-received” in a date range
 ~S 	        superseded messages
 ~s EXPR 	    messages having EXPR in the “Subject:” field
 ~T 	        tagged messages
 ~t EXPR 	    messages addressed to EXPR
 ~U 	        unread messages
 ~u 	        messages addressed to a subscribed mailing list
 ~V 	        cryptographically verified messages
 ~v 	        message is part of a collapsed thread.
 ~X MIN - MAX 	messages with MIN to MAX attachments ** )
 ~x EXPR 	    messages which contain EXPR in the “References:” or “In-Reply-To:” field
 ~y EXPR 	    messages which contain EXPR in their keywords
 ~z MIN - MAX 	messages with a size in the range MIN to MAX ** ) *** )
 =/ STRING 	    IMAP custom server-side search for STRING . Currently only defined for Gmail. See section “ Gmail Patterns ” in NeoMutt manual.
 ~= 	        duplicated messages (see $duplicate_threads)
 ~# 	        broken threads (see $strict_threads)
 ~$ 	        unreferenced message (requires threaded view)
 ~( PATTERN ) 	messages in threads containing messages matching PATTERN , e.g. all threads containing messages from you: ~(~P)
 ~<( PATTERN ) 	messages whose immediate parent matches PATTERN , e.g. replies to your messages: ~<(~P)
 ~>( PATTERN ) 	messages having an immediate child matching PATTERN , e.g. messages you replied to: ~>(~P)

 Where EXPR is a regular expression, and GROUP is an address group.

  * ) 	The message number ranges (introduced by “ ~m ”) are even more general and powerful than the other types of ranges. Read on and see section “ Message Ranges ” in manual.
  ** ) 	The forms “< MAX ”, “> MIN ”, “ MIN -” and “- MAX ” are allowed, too.
  *** ) 	The suffixes “K” and “M” are allowed to specify kilobyte and megabyte respectively.
